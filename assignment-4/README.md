ASSIGNMENT 4
========
This assignment is designed to help you practice the concepts of Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

#### Task 1 ####

Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

In the tastk-1.py file following is the algorithm explaination of the code.
1. We use try-except-finally since our objective is to handle errors gracefully.
2. We assign a variable named 'file' where we open and assign read operation to the file.
3. We individually read two lines from the file.
4. We add an exception error.
5. Finally we print the result and close the file.

#### Task 2 ####

Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.


In the tastk-2.py file following is the algorithm explaination of the code.
1. We assign a variable named 'file' where we open and assign read operation to the file and concatenate its data into variable 'data'.
2. We take 2 inputs from user. First input is the initial data that we insert in the file and second input is what we append into the file.
3. Then we print the stripped data in the desired output format and close the file.
