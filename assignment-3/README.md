ASSIGNMENT 3
========
This assignment is designed to help you practice the concepts of Functions and Modules in Python.


### Task 1 ###
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

In the tastk-1.py file following is the algorithm explaination of the code.
1. take a number as input from the user which is stored in the variable 'n'.
2. define a function named 'factorial' that takes a number as an argument.
3. Inside the function, calculate the factorial using a loop or recursion. In our case used loop.
4. The function returns the calculated factorial.
5. call the function with a sample number and print the output.


### Task 2 ###
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
    I. Square root of the number
    II. Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
    III. Sine of the number (in radians)

3.   Displays the calculated results.

In the task-2.py file following is the algorithm explaination of the code.
1. Import the math module to use its functions.
2. Take a number as float data type input from the user which is stored in the variable 'number'.
3. Calculate the square root of the number using math.sqrt() function.
4. Calculate the natural logarithm of the number using math.log() function.
5. Calculate the sine of the number in radians using math.sin() function.
6. Display the calculated results using print statements.
